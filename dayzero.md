Project Description:
dayzero is commitment contest platform.

people want to commit to something - be it an activity, a hobby, exercise routine or anything. but they often cheat since no one hold them accountable.

dayzero ensures that you remain committed to your cause. join the challenge, or create your own. post daily updates, if you fail your staked amount gets slashed which is distributed among the people who are honest and disciplined.

you can start any time, you dont have wait for the new year or any big even. everyday is day zero to learn something new.

the current verification system is based on admin approval. we intend to extend it to
1. submitting and verifying the proof of work using reclaim protocol
2. verifying using community voting
3. batch approval
